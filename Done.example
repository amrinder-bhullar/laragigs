You'll only see the product in NBIS Dashboard when a product has at-least 1 signup email. Emails will be sent out once you change quantity in inventory or you can choose to disable automatic Emails settings you can change the colour of button or text as well in translation.

If you are allowing products to oversell (sell even when out of stock) the form won't show because it's considered as normal product by shopify not out of stock product.

<------------- Easy Redirect Error ------------------------>

you already have a redirect for that path.
​
​Please go to: Online Store > Navigation > URL Redirects | under the title Navigation find the redirect with path either remove it or edit it. Shopify does not allow you to overwrite the redirect you need to remove the previous one. In case the path and target are as you want them to be and it is not redirecting then that is because the path is an active URL. Shopify allows only inactive(404) URLs to be redirected, please follow this guide which explains how it works:https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/How-to-Create-your-first-URL-Redirect-b817bc1c36044a06b18172b51219235a
​
​Kind regards

<---- How Size Matters work -->

The way Size matters work is as following it targets the tag so if you have added the tag in a product it does not matter the category or anything else the chart will show up.
​
​For example, once you have added the code(or we can do it for you in theme files) in shoes if you are already using tag shoes you can create a chart in the app add the tag shoes to chart it will show up in all the products that have tag shoes in them.
​
​Please use the following guide to create charts:https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/Intro-to-Size-Matters-3cf5db8564c9478ca1d13e6ab5835dc8
​
​Let me know if you have any other issues or queries.
​

<---------- NBIS Emails troubleshooting ---------->

​Sometimes it may take a while to send out notifications as well depending on traffic servers have to deal with. Please follow these steps, it might be one of these issues.

1. The product you are trying to send out notification for must have a positive inventory so quantity NOT 0, must be at-least 1.
2. Check automatic emails are not disabled in settings https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/ Disable-Automatic-Emails-Notification-90f2d46230284b5fad27b513e8d03e6e
3. Please confirm that you have not changed, added, deleted the variant before sending out the notifications. In this case, NBIS will not able to determine the correct variant hence will not send out emails.
4. Use "check stock" button only if automatic emails are disabled or you changed the inventory while automatic emails were disabled and you have enabled it after updating it, use "Check stock" to send notifications.
5. If you changed an out of stock product to "Continue to sell even out of stock" it will not send out notifications unless you add +1 inventory.
6. It may take from few minutes to few hours to send out emails so wait for around 1 - 4 hours and check sent out emails log: https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/View-sent-emails-in-Now-Back-in-Stock-b2a87bd5b9a14b968e0309761d2203ff
7. Have you modified the variants? deleted or changed anything like variant name etc? if yes you may have a different variant ID from the original which causes issue because now the subscriptions you have may not be used directly to trigger those emails.

if the problem still persists please inform me so I can take a look.

Kind Regards

<-------- Easy Redirect Primary and Secondary domain ------->

​Thanks for contacting support, Our app may help you once you have configured everything else.
​
Here's the process to follow:
​
​So in order to achieve desired result here's what you can do: Add https://mainWebsite.com/ as primary domain in shopify, and https://SecondWebsite.com as secondary domain, this will route all the traffic from old domain to new one.

​If you are using third party Registrar you can simply point your dns to your shopify website or create a redirect in your domain management panel.
​​
​Once visitor is on https://MainWebsite.com/ new domain then follow these steps :

From https://SecondWebsite.com/shirts/follow-me-shirt-navy/ TO. https://MainWebsite.com/products/follow-me-shirt-navy or https://MainWebsite.com/collections/tops/products/follow-me-shirt-navy same thing.

Here's how it will work: once you have added your website to shopify, you must create either all simple redirects

Path: /shirts/follow-me-shirt-navy/
Target: /products/follow-me-shirt-navy

products in collections and products are /collections/tops/products/follow-me-shirt-navy = /products/follow-me-shirt-navy both same

You can follow this guide for bulk upload: https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/How-to-upload-bulk-url-redirect-9537fda949b74655b2b67f5ff85bf817

The better way if this is going to be true for all products then you can use Redirect Pattern:

Path: /shirts/✱
Target: /products/●

Please let me know if this answers your question or if you have any other query.

Kind Regards

​If your previous domain was on shopify you might not need our app if you create all the urls as they were previously created. If you change category or name etc or you were using a different platform.

<-------------------- Easy Redirect troubleshooting ---------------->

Please follow these steps to identify the problem:
​

1. ​Shopify does not allow to redirect page that exists(active = not 404), you can only redirect from a page once it has been removed so a 404.
   ​
   ​If this is not the case then
   ​
   ​2) Please check the URL: It must be something like this Path: /products/name-of-the-product | Target: /collections/name-of-collection
   ​\*Note: /collections/name-of-collection/products/name-of-the-product is same as /products/name-of-the-product
   ​
   ​3) If you need to redirect to external website, make sure the path must be 404 and target must be added like this: http://TargetWebsite.com/
   ​
   ​4) If you are getting getting an error: Redirect Creation Failed. Make sure path is unique
   ​
   ​in this case please check you are not adding the path again. Just to make sure copy the path and paste it after your domain yourwebsite.com/copied-path if it is redirecting it means that there's already a redirection created with this path and it is not possible to redirect it again unless old redirection is not deleted.
   ​
   ​If you are still unable to resolve the problem, Please let me know what errors are you getting and if possible include Screenshot.
   ​
   ​Kind Regard

<------------- How does NBIS works and integration --------------->

Hi,

Thank you for contacting support,

Now Back in Stock does not need any software or third-party service to work. Once you install it and add the code to your store ( we offer free support for installation).

Your visitor can sign-up on products that are currently out of stock. Once they are back in stock and you update the inventory NBIS will check it and will send the emails automatically without you doing anything.

We have MailChimp and dotmailer integration if user wants to capture the signed up emails to send them newsletter or offers later.

---------- URL Redirects -------------------------->

-------------------- 404 Fix Error --------------->

Hi , You can get this error when there is already a redirect for that path. Please check it by going to the URL. If it redirects it means you need to delete previous one in order to create new one. If it is redirecting where you want it to redirect then simply ignore it.

You can check if it already exists by going here: Online Store > Navigation > URL Redirects | under the title Navigation.

Shopify allows you to redirect only if the path is inactive URL(404), in order to redirect from this page/product either please disable it or delete it. It should return a 404 error if redirect is already added it will just start redirecting.

<---------- Size Matters how to add images ------->

Hi,

Thank you for contacting support,

Please follow this guide if you wish to add the image in a cell: https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/How-to-add-image-to-Size-Matters-Chart-3b624fbd626b4694b1ae1ea69a3f591e

Please let me know if you have any other issues or queries.

Kind regards

<---------- How redirect patterns work ---------->

Usually, you would have to create a CSV file with old URLs and new URLs and upload it and app can create redirects for you.

Other solution might be, redirect using redirect patterns, you'll need to find patterns in your URLs and create patterns which will redirect according to it.

For example you have URL yourstore.com/collections/xyz/products/abc you want to redirect all the inactive URLs from /collections/xyz/products/abc to /collections/MNO/

You can create a pattern /collections/xyz/_ target /collections/MNO/_

the target URL must not be 404, so you must have a product in /collections/MNO/products/abc

So when you visit yourstore.com/collections/xyz/products/abc it will redirect to yourstore.com/collections/MNO/products/abc

Please let me know if you have any other issues or queries.

Kind regards

<-- Why there are no 404 errors in 404 Dashboard -->

​a 404 error occurs when a URL is inactive in your domain and does not result in anything. You might have deleted or disabled some products which means their URLs return a 404 error, now if you have there URLs in newsletters or on social media when someone clicks on it they will get a 404 error and will not able to purchase the product.
​
What Easy Redirect does is, report to you that someone hit a 404 page so you can redirect it. Easy Redirect DOES NOT tell you 404 before someone gets an error because every random URL can be a 404 so they are infinite.
​
If you have recently installed Easy redirects so there is no database from where it can pull the data of what URLs are resulting in 404s, but it will help you build a database over time.
​
Please let me know if you have any other issues or queries.​
​
​Kind regards

<------ how Size matters work ----->

​Size matters help you create and display size charts, first you need to go to the app in apps sections, when you click on it you will be taken to the dashboard where you can create size guides, the app hasn't got size guides you need to create it according to your product, either your supplier has given you the measurements or you can measure it yourself.
​
​Once you have created the size chart you need to add the chart name and the TAG now it is very important to use the tag, that is how Size matters is able to identify where it should render the size guide.
​
​The app is designed in a way that you can create as many size guides as you wish, all you need to do is add the exact same(be careful of uppercase or lowercase) tag, if the product has the same tag it will display the size guide if it does not has the tag it will not display it.
​
​As I told you earlier this is a step-by-step guide: https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/Intro-to-Size-Matters-3cf5db8564c9478ca1d13e6ab5835dc8 you can follow it's step apply the same method to your size guides and you should be up and running.

Hi,

Please follow this guide for bulk upload redirects: https://www.notion.so/eastsideco/How-to-upload-bulk-url-redirect-9537fda949b74655b2b67f5ff85bf817

To discuss with Jason:

NBIS - reinstallation

NBIS sending out notifications even if product is not online

3rd time in a week where SM was not displaying on a store asyncLoad() issues.

Tobi had an issue with cart convert on new theme, CC does not support multi-currency

Easy redirects a banner when redirecting to new URL "Sorry the item you were looking for has been soldout we think these may intrest you!"

Easy Redirects:

It is used to create 301 redirects in shopify, i.e. when you delete a product and don't want to lose SEO so you redirect it to another product and vitior will not hit a 404 page on your store.

The redirect needs to meet 2 conditions the path(old URL) must be 404 and target(new URL) needs to be an active URL.

in the premium version of the app it logs all the URLs that have hit the 404 page because they do not exist on the server anymore. You can fix 404s from that dashboard, you can also fix 404s by downloading them as CSV and add target(new URL) and upload it to the app, but doing so will not clear the 404 logs automatically if you wish to clear it you need to do it one by one we cannot do it from our side(backend)

Premium version also includes redirect patterns where you define the pattern which the app would check if the 404 meets the defined condition of pattern app creates a redirect for it automatically.

It is merchants job to understand how the redirect patterns work and add them according to their need we do not create redirects patterns or upload CSV for them.

Wishlist:

The app is designed to show up on product page where user can save the product in wishlist by clicking on heart icon, and can retrive the saved items in wishlist page.

We do not save any user specific data, we don't have user's name/email etc the data which is saved in database is mostly for the app and even though we can export the data but it is pretty much useless for anyone else.

We can do the initial setup and look into an app specific issue(like wishlist not showing up or CSS issues)

Back in Stock:

Back is designed to show up on product page specifically and will render only if variant/product is out of stock. Once signed up customer will get notified when a product is back in stock. If the merchant deletes/modifies the product and shopify assigns a new variant ID to the product previous emails/subscriptions will not be triggered because the variant ID where app is listening to changes is not active anymore at that point merchant needs to get the data from old product and add to new product(when it is out of stock or change settings in app to not send out notifications unless it hits a certain quota).

App has an interface to export data so we do not do it from the backend unless they run into an issue.
